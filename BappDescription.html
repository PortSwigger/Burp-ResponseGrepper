<p>Burp extension to auto-extract values from HTTP Responses based on a Regular Expression. Extracts the match and any named or unnamed groups. A bit like Burp Intruder's &quot;Grep - Extract&quot; option, but should work on any Responses.</p>

<p>The regex is defined per-request. It will extract the full match, and also highlight and extract any groups defined in the regex. Named groups can also be used for more detail in the regex.</p>
