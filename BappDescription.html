<p>This extension will auto-extract and display values from HTTP Response
bodies based on a Regular Expression, similarly to the &quot;Grep - Extract&quot;
feature in Burp Intruder but will work on any Responses. This can be
helpful when trying to perform manual reconnaissance or building an
injection in Burp Repeater, without having to scroll through multiple
matches in the Response search results.</p>

<p>The Regular Expression is defined per-request. It will extract the full
match, and also highlight and extract any groups defined in the regex,
and display them in a list on a new tab. Named groups can also be used
for more detail in the regex.</p>

<p>Set the Regular Expression in the tab, click &quot;update&quot;, hit &quot;enter&quot;, or
run the request to apply it. Matching subgroups are highlighted in the
match and also extracted. For example, to extract the value between 2
DIV tags:</p>

<code>&lt;div class='test'&gt;(.*?)&lt;/div&gt;</code>

<p>Named groups can also be used INSTEAD (don't mix named and unnamed). For
example:</p>

<code>&lt;div class='test'&gt;(?P&lt;tag&gt;.*?)&lt;/div&gt;</code>
